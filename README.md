# 1st-project-Hack36-
My project will be building a platform for covid-19 information. It will also contain a form that will ask for some covid related information. However, it will not store data anywhere.
There is a navigation bar there that will assist the user to navigate through the platform. 
There is also a link named "For more info" in navigation bar that will direct the viewer to official WHO website.
The data displayed on the website is taken from WHO website.
There is return link on each of the connected page to return to Home page.
